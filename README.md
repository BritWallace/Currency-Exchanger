_A Epicodus school project.  We created a currency exchange application.  A user should be able to type in an amount in U.S. dollars and then choose which currency it should be converted to (such as francs, marks, rupees, and so on). This will determine the most recent exchange rate. If the query response doesn't include that particular currency, the application should return a notification that states the currency in question doesn't exist. _
